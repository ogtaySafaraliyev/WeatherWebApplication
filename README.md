# 🌤️ Weather Web Application

A simple, dynamic web application that allows users to search for current weather information by city. This project demonstrates the integration of Java Servlets with a RESTful API to create a responsive, interactive frontend backed by a Java-powered backend.

## ❓ What problem does the project solve? Or, what does it do?

This application solves the problem of quickly retrieving real-time weather data in a clean and easy-to-use interface. Instead of navigating through complex weather websites, users can input a city name and receive key information such as temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions — all in one place.

## 🛠️ Why these technologies?

- **Java (Servlet API)**: Used for handling backend logic and HTTP requests.
- **Apache HttpClient**: To call external REST APIs (specifically, OpenWeatherMap).
- **HTML & CSS**: For the frontend design, creating a responsive and clean user interface.
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: To display dynamic content and bind weather data.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides up-to-date weather information based on city name input.

These technologies were chosen to demonstrate full-stack Java web development using core Servlet principles instead of using heavy frameworks, keeping the application lightweight and understandable for beginners.
